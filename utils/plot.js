      "As you approach the soccer field, you notice a bunch of campers in separate groups, chatting with one another. Camp Counselor Heather makes an announcement over the megaphone: 'ATTENTION CAMPERS - PLEASE CIRCLE UP AND TAKE A SEAT, WE HAVE AN IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE…' \nOnce the commotion subsides and everyone is seated, the head of camp, Barb starts to speak, hesitantly… 'Campers, we don’t want to alarm you, but another person has gone missing this week. Camp Counselor Dalonte has not been seen since last night’s game of Capture the Flag. Because of this, we think it would be best for all of you to go home early. We know it’s not ideal, but we don’t want to risk losing any more of you. We’ve contacted your families to come pick you up.’\nShe continues… ‘Back in 1974, when I was a camper, just like you, something like this began happening  where other campers went missing. First, one camper disappeared, then the numbers exponentially grew…until 13 campers and counselors seemed to vanish out of thin air. \nThey didn’t send us home, so we were stuck in our cabins every day, fearing we were next and  just praying we would be sent home. Police were called. Investigations were made. Pastors, rabbis, and any clergy folk  would try and cleanse the grounds. They all said the problem would never occur again after their “work,” so the camp remained open and the case of the missing persons became a mystery of the decade. I’ve gotten off track and I am not trying to scare you.\nYou all have 2 hours - head back to your cabins, pack up your things and meet at the main circle to load the buses.' The chatter and fear was palpable as everyone reluctantly stood up from their spots and quickly made their way back to their cabins to pack up their things.",
